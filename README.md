### A responsive webpage using **Flexbox**,  **CSS Grid**,  **Media Queries** and JavaScript.

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

This is an ongoing mini IG project in which I've been implementing semantic HTML, responsive design, JavaScript and OOP principles.

### First Stage: Styling and Responsiveness

**HTML** üîß
- Markup is semantic. 
- CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology.**

**RESPONSIVENESS AND STYLING** üíÖ
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were combined for the layout of the cards.
- The page is responsive up to 320px.

**CSS TRANSITIONS** ‚ú®
- Opacity changes when hovering over buttons.

**BUTTONS** üéØ
- Edit profile button opens a form to modify profile information.
- Add card button opens a form to add a new image.

**JAVASCRIPT** ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Used to control the forms behavior.
- I used **textContent** property to return values on the forms and show the most recent changes on them.

### Second Stage: Turning the JavaScript switch on! üöÄ

**JAVASCRIPT** ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Cards are rendered dynamically.
- Implementation of event handlers.
- Users can **add a new image card** with a URL of their choosing. Try it out! :white_check_mark:
- Cards can get **deleted** :x: 
- Cards can get **liked** :heart: and **unliked** :broken_heart:
- Image too small? No problem amigo! I gotchu, :raised_hands: click on the image to enlarge. 

**CSS TRANSITIONS** ‚ú®
- Smooth transitions were used when opening/closing image modals and forms. :sunglasses: nothing popping in and out suddenly.

**RESPONSIVENESS AND STYLING** üíÖ
- When opening an image modal, the image is **adaptive** to the screen size.

### Third Stage: Adding more functionalities üë©‚Äçüíª

**JAVASCRIPT** ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Enabling form validation. 
- Closing modals using Esc key.
- Closing modals when clicking in the image overlay.

### Fourth Stage: Getting started with OOP ü•∑

**ENCAPSULATION** ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Implementing the use of private and public methods and properties.
- Implementing the use of imports/exports.
- Class creation to separate dynamic markup from static markup.
- Implementing "this" to reduce memory space.

### Next steps
* Keep learning JavaScript!!
