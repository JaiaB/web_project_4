### A responsive webpage using **Flexbox**,  **CSS Grid**,  **Media Queries** and JavaScript.

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

This is an ongoing project in which I start adding interactivity with JavaScript.

### First Stage: Styling and Responsiveness
**Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were combined for the layout of the cards and the text inside them.
**CSS** 
The profile section was styled with **Flexbox** and **Media Queries** up to 320px for the behavior of the elements in the section.
Buttons feature **CSS transitions** when hovering over them to change opacity. 
The edit button is clickable and opens a form to edit the profile information on the page. 
This webpage was originally designed for a 1280px resolution. It's responsive up to 320px. 
**HTML** markup is semantic, CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology.**
The form's behavior is controlled by **JavaScript**,  I used **textContent** property to return values on the form and **functions** to show the most recent changes on the form.

### Second Stage: Turning the JavaScript switch on!
Users can **add a new image card** with a link of their choosing from the web by clicking on the "Plus" button. Try it out! :white_check_mark:
Cards can get **deleted** :x: 
Cards can get **liked** :heart: and **unliked** :broken_heart:
Image too small? No problem amigo! I gotchu, :raised_hands: click on the image to enlarge. 
The enlarged image is **adaptive** to the screen size
The profile edit, add a card forms and the enlarged image have **smooth transitions** :sunglasses: nothing popping in and out suddenly.

### Next steps
* Keep learning JavaScript!!
