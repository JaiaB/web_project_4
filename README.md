### A responsive webpage using **Flexbox**,  **CSS Grid**,  **Media Queries** and JavaScript.

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

This is an ongoing mini IG project in which I've been implementing semantic HTML, responsive design, JavaScript and OOP principles.

### First Stage: Styling and Responsiveness

**HTML** üîß
- Markup is semantic. 
- CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology.**

**RESPONSIVENESS AND STYLING** üíÖ
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were combined for the layout of the cards.
- The page is responsive up to 320px.

**CSS TRANSITIONS** ‚ú®
- Opacity changes when hovering over buttons.
- Smooth transitions when opening/closing forms and image modals.

**BUTTONS** üéØ
- Edit profile button opens a form to modify profile information.
- Add card button opens a form to add a new image using a URL.

**JAVASCRIPT** ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Used to control the forms behavior.
- I used **textContent** property to return values on the forms and show the most recent changes on them.

### Second Stage: Turning the JavaScript switch on!
Users can **add a new image card** with a link of their choosing from the web by clicking on the "Plus" button. Try it out! :white_check_mark:

Cards can get **deleted** :x: 

Cards can get **liked** :heart: and **unliked** :broken_heart:

Image too small? No problem amigo! I gotchu, :raised_hands: click on the image to enlarge. 

The enlarged image is **adaptive** to the screen size

The profile edit, add a card forms and the enlarged image have **smooth transitions** :sunglasses: nothing popping in and out suddenly.

### Third Stage: Enabling form validation, Closing modals using Esc key and when clicking in the area surrounding the image
If form fields are incorrect or incomplete, users won't be able to create a new card.

Users are able to exit the form modals and image modals by clicking in the area surrounding modal/picture, or if they use the Esc key. 


### Next steps
* Keep learning JavaScript!!
